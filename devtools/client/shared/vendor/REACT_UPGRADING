We have a version of React that has a few minor patches on top of it:
https://github.com/mozilla/react. These instructions are how to
upgrade to the latest version of React.

First, rebase our fork on top of the latest version and publish it to
our repo.

Next, build React. You should already have our fork locally; make sure
you are building our fork: https://github.com/mozilla/react

* npm install
* grunt build
* cp build/react-with-addons.js <gecko-dev>/devtools/client/shared/vendor/react-dev.js

Note that the last command above adds a `react-dev.js` file. You also
need to generated a production version of React:

* NODE_ENV=production grunt build
* cp build/react-with-addons.js <gecko-dev>/devtools/client/shared/vendor/react.js

You also need to copy the ReactDOM package. It requires React, so
right now we are just manually changing the path from `react` to
`devtools/client/shared/vendor/react`.

* cp build/react-dom.js <gecko-dev>/devtools/client/shared/vendor/react-dom.js
* (change `require('react')` at the top of the file to the right path)
