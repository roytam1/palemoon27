/**
 * Provides an interface to implement a cross thread/process wrapper for a
 * gfxImageSurface that has copy-on-write semantics.
 *
 * Only the owner thread can write to the surface and acquire
 * read locks. Destroying a gfxReusableSurfaceWrapper releases
 * a read lock.
 *
 * OMTC Usage:
 * 1) Content creates a writable copy of this surface
 *    wrapper which will be optimized to the same wrapper if there
 *    are no readers.
 * 2) The surface is sent from content to the compositor once
 *    or potentially many times, each increasing a read lock.
 * 3) When the compositor receives the surface, it adopts the
 *    read lock.
 * 4) Once the compositor has processed the surface and uploaded
 *    the content, it then releases the read lock by dereferencing
 *    its wrapper.
